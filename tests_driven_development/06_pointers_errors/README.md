# Pointers & Errors

- In Go, when you call a function or a method, the arguments are copied.
- pointer: address of where the value is stored in the memory: `&myValue`
- [Pointers](https://gobyexample.com/pointers) let us point to some values and then let us change them.
- These pointers to structs even have their own name: struct pointers and they are [automatically dereferenced](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Method_values).
- If you see a function that takes arguments or returns values that are interfaces, they can be nillable (we can use `nil`).

## Topics covered
- pointers
- `nil`
- errors
- create new types from existing one
