# Everything Go

This repository includes all my code while learning the concepts of Golang!

## Theory
### Some facts about Go

- developed by Google in 2007 
- open Sourced in 2009

### Why do we need Go? - Go Use cases

- Over the years, infrastructure became:
  - Scalable & Distributed
  - Dynamic
  - More Capacity
- Multi-Threading Use Cases
  - running two or more processes in parallel
- Built-in concurrency mechanism

Essentially, here are is the main use case of Go:
- Building performant applications
- Running on scaled, distributed systems i.e. where there are 100s or 1000s of servers!
- Mostly use with Cloud Development

### Characteristics of Go

- Go is an attempt to combine:
  - simple and readable syntax of a language like Python (which is dynamically typed)
  - efficiency and safety of a low-level language like C++ (which is statically typed)
- Mostly used as a server-side or backend language
- Can be used to write:
  - microservices
  - web apps
  - database services
- Few examples of production-grade Go use cases:
  - Kubernetes 
  - Docker
  - Hashicorp Vault
  - Cockroach DB
- Compiled language - That means this can be compiled into a single binary (machine code) and we can use this same binary file across different OS

### Some Advantages
- Simple syntax: easy to learn, read and write code
- Fast build time, start up and run time
- Requires fewer resources
  - Efficient garbage collection (GC)
